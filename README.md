# Black Ops 3 Source

Dump of some parts of BO3 using [Atian Call of Duty Tools](https://github.com/ate47/atian-cod-tools), please create an issue on the tools directory if you find a strange decompiled code.

It's a simple port of my tools I've made because I was bored, you can probably find a better one somewhere else.
