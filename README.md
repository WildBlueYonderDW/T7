# Black Ops 3 Source

Dump of some parts of BO3 using [Atian Call of Duty Tools](https://github.com/ate47/atian-cod-tools).

It's a simple port of my decompiler I've made because I was bored, you can probably find a better one somewhere else.

I don't why, but the game has script with 2 different VMs loaded. `vm-1c` are the scripts used by the game.
