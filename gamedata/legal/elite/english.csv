1188,22. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
1189,
1190,
1191,PLEASE READ THIS SECTION 22 CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING 
1192,YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT 
1193,
1194,
1195,
1196,Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.
1197,This Section 22 applies to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Product in the USA.
1198,This Section 22 may also apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Product from outside the 
1199,USA. See Section 23 for details.
1200,(A) Initial Dispute Resolution:  Our Customer Support department is available by phone (800 225-6588) or on the 
1201,web (support.activision.com) to address any concerns you may have regarding the Product. Most concerns are 
1202,quickly resolved in this manner to our customer’s satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any 
1203,dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be 
1204,a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
1205,(B) Binding Arbitration:  If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the 
1206,time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to paragraph (a) above, then either party may initiate binding 
1207,arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below.  Specifically, all 
1208,claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including its formation, performance and breach), the parties’ 
1209,relationship with each other and/or your use of the Product shall be finally settled by binding arbitration 
1210,administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial 
1211,Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration 
1212,Association (the “AAA”), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.  The arbitrator, 
1213,and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out 
1214,of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not 
1215,limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to 
1216,arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or 
1217,in equity.  The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of 
1218,competent jurisdiction.  The Commercial Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed 
1219,at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at +1.800.778.7879.  To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds 
1220,the cost of filing a lawsuit, Activision will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-
1221,frivolous, Activision will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does 
1222,not exceed $75,000. The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. The parties 
1223,understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury 
1224,trial.  They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of 
1225,litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
1226,
1227,(C)    Location.  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location 
1228,within the United States convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated 
1229,in the County of Los Angeles, State of California, United States of America, and you and Activision agree to submit 
1230,to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles County, California, in order to compel 
1231,arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award 
1232,entered by the arbitrator.
1233,
1234,Class Action Waiver
1235,
1236,(D) Class Action Waiver:  The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual 
1237,capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right 
1238,to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.  YOU AND ACTIVISION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS 
1239,AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER 
1240,IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  If any court or arbitrator determines that the class 
1241,action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed 
1242,on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in paragraph (B) shall be deemed null and void in its 
1243,entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.  
1244,
1245,(E)  Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims:  Notwithstanding the parties' 
1246,decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to 
1247,protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, 
1248,trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy, publicity rights, or the license granted under Section 3 of this 
1249,Agreement).  Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that 
1250,court’s jurisdiction.  
1251,
1252,(F) 30 Day Right to Opt Out:  You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action 
1253,waiver provisions set forth in paragraphs (B), (C) and (D) by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to 
1254,the following address: Activision Publishing, Inc., of 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90405-3032, 
1255,Attn: Business and Legal Affairs. The notice must be sent within 30 days of purchasing the Product (or if no 
1256,purchase was made, then within 30 days of the date on which you first access or use the Product), otherwise you 
1257,shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs.  If you opt-out of these 
1258,arbitration provisions, Activision also will not be bound by them.
